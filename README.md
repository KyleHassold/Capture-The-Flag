# Capture-The-Flag
This is the code I used to solve various challenges in a capture the flag during my free time in my computer science class in high school with some friends.

Each folder is a seperate challenge. Some were completed while others remained unanswered. Overall, it was a fun and informative experience especially with the diversity of challenges.
